<h1>Golden Whistle</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Golden Whistle is the highest rank achieved by an official at BYU-Idaho. Since BYU-Idaho does not require national/district certifications for recreational and most competitive sports, a golden whistle signifies that an official has advanced their ability in their sport and has had a positive impact on the sporting program.</p>
<h2>Whistle Rankings</h2>
<p>Each rank is established based on an official's duration in the program, ability as a referee, knowledge and application of the rules, and level of professionalism. The program is designed to allow officials to achieve an increase in rank each semester they officiate.</p>
